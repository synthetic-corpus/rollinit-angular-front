  <mat-card-title>What Is this?</mat-card-title>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      This is a tool to automatically roll initative at the push of a button.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is intended to replace the sometimes cumbersome, and game flow breaking process
      of players rolling iniative, dm rolling for monsters, then calling out order etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool still assumes table top play in which the DM will use tents cards.
      It is optimized for table top, in person play, specifically for Adventure's League games.
